# No teleporting

Disables teleportation of resources in the following situations:

* When resource is traded, traffic reduction is no longer applied, generating a trip for every trade action
* Companies will no longer spawn with initial resources, requiring them to buy them before they can start producing goods (can be configured in the options with a custom initial resource amount)

I have tested this mod with a city of 20k population and it works fine. If you have a larger city, please let me know if you encounter any issues.

## Compatibility

This mod is compatible with mods that change the traffic reduction amount. Those mods will still work for all other kinds of traffic reduction the game has (the amount of people going to work/school/leisure activities etc.).
